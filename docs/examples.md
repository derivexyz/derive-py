# Examples

The best way to learn Derive is by running the example scripts. All examples are complete, runnable Python scripts with detailed comments.

## Prerequisites

The examples use `.env.template` with pre-configured testnet credentials - you can run them immediately without setup!

```bash
git clone git@github.com:8ball030/derive_py.git
cd derive_py
python examples/01_quickstart.py
```
