"""
Example of how to act as a RFQ quoter with delta hedging.

This is a more advanced example that demonstrates a realistic market-making strategy:
- Connects to the WebSocket API and listens for incoming RFQs
- Prices legs using current market bid-ask prices (not just mark prices)
- Implements a delta-hedging strategy to manage options exposure
- Monitors portfolio delta and automatically hedges when outside risk limits

Delta hedging explained:
- Options have "delta" - how much their value changes when the underlying asset moves
- When we sell options, we take on delta exposure to the underlying asset
- Delta hedging means trading the underlying (perpetuals) to neutralize this exposure
- This protects us from directional price risk, leaving us with pure volatility exposure

Strategy flow:
1. Receive RFQ -> Calculate if accepting would exceed our delta limits
2. If safe to quote -> Price using current bid-ask + spread
3. When quote is filled -> Calculate new portfolio delta
4. If delta exceeds limits -> Execute hedge trade in the underlying perpetual
5. Continuously monitor and rebalance delta exposure

IMPORTANT: While more realistic than the simple quoter, this is still educational.
IT SHOULD NOT BE USED AS A TRADING STRATEGY without additional risk management!
