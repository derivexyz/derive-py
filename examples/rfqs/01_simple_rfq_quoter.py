"""
Example of how to act as a simple RFQ quoter that prices incoming RFQs and sends quotes.

This example demonstrates the market maker side of RFQ trading:
- Connects to the WebSocket API and listens for incoming RFQs on a specified wallet
- Prices the legs using current market prices with a small spread
- Sends quotes back to the RFQs
- Listens for quote updates to track the status of quotes sent (filled, expired, etc.)

IMPORTANT: This is a simplified example for educational purposes.
IT SHOULD NOT BE USED AS A TRADING STRATEGY!!!
The pricing logic here does not account for:
- Risk management (position limits, exposure limits)
- Proper spread calculation based on volatility and liquidity
- Greeks hedging (delta, gamma, vega, theta)
- Inventory management
